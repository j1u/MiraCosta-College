How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

I get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses around 75% of the time. It does change depending on the theory I test,
for example theory 1 will be solved very quickly because the ordered triplet 1,1,1 is the default check for my algorithm.
For theory 2, it will always take a pretty huge amount of guesses because I am looping through each solution linearly
from 1-6 or 1-10 respectively. For theory 3 it depends if there are multiple wrong and the numerical order of each item
found in the switch statement.


What is good or bad about this strategy?

It exhausts every possibility for each item, however as the number and range of items increase my algorithm becomes more
and more inefficient.
